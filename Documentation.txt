1. We've created our txt file, app.py and models.py

2. Steps we followed:
     - pipenv install
     - pipenv shell
     - pipenv install flask
     - pipenv install flask-sqlalchemy
     - pipenv install flask-migrate
     - pipenv install sqlalchemy_serializer
     - pipenv install sqlalchemy
     - pipenv install flask-restful
     - pipenv install faker

3. We created a Course, Student Model using sqlalchemy and serializermixin

4. We then put together the realtionship between the courses and students

5. In app.py, we then imported the necessary files such as flask_restful, migrate and our models

6. We setup our flask environment using FLASK_APP and FLASK_RUN_PORT

7. We initiated our first migration through flask db init, flask db migrate, flask db upgrade head

8. We created seed data for our database through faker
